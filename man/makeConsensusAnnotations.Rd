\title{makeConsensusAnnotations Makes a consensus annotation}
\usage{
makeConsensusAnnotations(ar, minGap = 1L, minWidth = 1000L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ar}{GRanges of annotations to be collapsed.}

\item{minGap}{Minimun gap between overlapped annotations after truncated.
Default: 1L}

\item{minWidth}{Minimun width of consensus annotations. Default: 1000L}

\item{...}{Extra argument passed to mclapply.}
}
\value{
Returns GRanges object of annotations.
}
\description{
Makes a non-overlapping consensus annotation.  Gene annotations are often
overalpping due to #' multiple isoforms for a gene.
In consensus annotation, isoforms are first reduced so that only
redundant intervals are used to represent a genomic interval for a gene,
i.e., a gene id.
Remaining unresolved annotations are further reduced by truncating 3'
end of annotations.
}
\details{
Supports parallel processing using mclapply in the 'parallel' package.
To change the number of processors, use the argument 'mc.cores'.

# columns=c("gene_id", "tx_id", "tx_name"))
# tx <- tx[grep("random", as.character(seqnames(tx)), invert=TRUE),]
# ca <- makeConsensusAnnotations(tx)
